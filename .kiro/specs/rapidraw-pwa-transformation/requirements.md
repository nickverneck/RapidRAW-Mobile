# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming RapidRAW from a Tauri desktop application into a mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) using SvelteKit with a glassmorphism UI design. The transformation will convert the React frontend to SvelteKit, migrate Rust backend functionality to WebAssembly where possible, implement responsive mobile/tablet interfaces, and add new color grading features including HSL controls, preset saving, and LUT export capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Framework Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from React to SvelteKit, so that I can leverage a more familiar and performant framework for the PWA implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use SvelteKit as the primary frontend framework
2. WHEN components are migrated THEN they SHALL maintain equivalent functionality to the original React components
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL generate optimized SvelteKit bundles for production
4. WHEN state management is implemented THEN it SHALL use Svelte stores instead of React state hooks
5. WHEN routing is configured THEN it SHALL use SvelteKit's file-based routing system

### Requirement 2: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to work seamlessly on my phone and tablet, so that I can edit photos on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on mobile devices THEN it SHALL display a touch-optimized interface
2. WHEN users interact with controls THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized for touch input (minimum 44px touch targets)
3. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively
4. WHEN users navigate between panels THEN they SHALL use mobile-appropriate navigation patterns (tabs, drawers, modals)
5. WHEN the application is used on tablets THEN it SHALL utilize the larger screen space effectively
6. WHEN touch gestures are used THEN they SHALL support pinch-to-zoom, pan, and swipe interactions

### Requirement 3: Progressive Web App Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the application on my device like a native app, so that I can access it offline and have a native-like experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL meet PWA criteria (service worker, manifest, HTTPS)
2. WHEN users visit the app THEN they SHALL be prompted to install it on their device
3. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. WHEN the app is offline THEN it SHALL provide basic functionality through service worker caching
5. WHEN the app updates THEN it SHALL notify users and allow them to refresh to the latest version

### Requirement 4: Glassmorphism UI Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, beautiful interface with glassmorphism effects, so that the application feels contemporary and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN panels are displayed THEN they SHALL use frosted glass effects with backdrop blur
2. WHEN elements overlap THEN they SHALL maintain visual hierarchy through transparency and blur
3. WHEN the theme is applied THEN it SHALL use subtle gradients and translucent backgrounds
4. WHEN animations occur THEN they SHALL be smooth and enhance the glassmorphism aesthetic
5. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the design SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios

### Requirement 5: WebAssembly Backend Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert Rust backend functionality to WebAssembly, so that image processing can run efficiently in the browser without server dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image processing functions are called THEN they SHALL execute via WebAssembly modules
2. WHEN RAW file processing occurs THEN it SHALL use WebAssembly-compiled rawler functionality
3. WHEN GPU operations are needed THEN they SHALL use WebGPU APIs where available
4. WHEN WebAssembly modules load THEN they SHALL initialize efficiently without blocking the UI
5. WHEN fallbacks are needed THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to JavaScript implementations

### Requirement 6: Touch-Optimized Image Editing

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to edit images using touch gestures, so that I can perform precise adjustments on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users adjust sliders THEN they SHALL support touch drag with haptic feedback
2. WHEN users crop images THEN they SHALL use touch handles and gesture controls
3. WHEN users apply masks THEN they SHALL use touch painting with pressure sensitivity where available
4. WHEN users zoom and pan THEN they SHALL use standard pinch and drag gestures
5. WHEN users make fine adjustments THEN they SHALL have access to precision input methods

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Color Grading System

**User Story:** As a photographer, I want advanced HSL color controls and the ability to save custom color grades, so that I can achieve precise color correction and maintain consistent looks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HSL controls are accessed THEN they SHALL provide separate Hue, Saturation, and Lightness adjustments for each color range
2. WHEN color adjustments are made THEN they SHALL update in real-time with smooth performance
3. WHEN users create a color grade THEN they SHALL be able to save it as a named preset
4. WHEN users want to reuse grades THEN they SHALL be able to browse and apply saved presets
5. WHEN color wheels are used THEN they SHALL provide intuitive color selection and adjustment

### Requirement 8: LUT Export Functionality

**User Story:** As a professional photographer, I want to export my color grades as LUT files, so that I can use them in other applications and maintain consistency across my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users complete a color grade THEN they SHALL be able to export it as a 3D LUT file
2. WHEN LUT export is triggered THEN it SHALL generate industry-standard .cube format files
3. WHEN LUT files are created THEN they SHALL accurately represent the applied color transformations
4. WHEN users export LUTs THEN they SHALL be able to specify LUT resolution (17x17x17, 33x33x33, etc.)
5. WHEN LUT metadata is included THEN it SHALL contain relevant information about the color grade

### Requirement 9: Test-Driven Development Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage using Playwright and backend testing tools, so that the application maintains quality and reliability throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are developed THEN they SHALL have corresponding Playwright tests
2. WHEN user workflows are implemented THEN they SHALL be covered by end-to-end tests
3. WHEN WebAssembly modules are created THEN they SHALL have unit tests for core functionality
4. WHEN the application is built THEN all tests SHALL pass before deployment
5. WHEN regressions occur THEN they SHALL be caught by the automated test suite

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform smoothly on mobile devices, so that I can edit images without lag or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are processed THEN the application SHALL maintain 60fps UI responsiveness
2. WHEN large images are loaded THEN they SHALL be progressively loaded and optimized for mobile
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN it SHALL stay within mobile device constraints
4. WHEN background processing occurs THEN it SHALL use web workers to avoid blocking the main thread
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load quickly with progressive enhancement

### Requirement 11: Offline Capability

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to edit photos even when I don't have internet connectivity, so that I can work anywhere without restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is offline THEN core editing functionality SHALL remain available
2. WHEN images are processed offline THEN they SHALL use cached WebAssembly modules
3. WHEN edits are made offline THEN they SHALL be saved locally and synced when online
4. WHEN the app goes offline THEN users SHALL be notified of the offline status
5. WHEN connectivity returns THEN any pending operations SHALL resume automatically

### Requirement 12: Cross-Platform Compatibility

2. WHEN the application runs on Android Chrome THEN it SHALL provide full functionality
3. WHEN WebAssembly is not supported THEN the application SHALL fall back to JavaScript implementations
4. WHEN WebGPU is not available THEN the application SHALL use WebGL or Canvas fallbacks
5. WHEN device capabilities vary THEN the application SHALL adapt its feature set accordingly
