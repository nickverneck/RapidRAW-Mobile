# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming RapidRAW from a Tauri desktop application into a mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) using SvelteKit with a glassmorphism UI design. The transformation will convert the React frontend to SvelteKit, migrate Rust backend functionality to WebAssembly where possible, implement responsive mobile/tablet interfaces, and add new color grading features including HSL controls, preset saving, and LUT export capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Framework Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from React to SvelteKit, so that I can leverage a more familiar and performant framework for the PWA implementation.
