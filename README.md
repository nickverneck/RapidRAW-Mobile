# RapidRAW

> A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.

RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

I started developing this project as a personal challenge when I was 18. My goal was to create a high-performance tool for my own photography workflow while deepening my understanding of React, WGSL and Rust, with the support from Google Gemini.

<summary><strong>For Who Is This?</strong></summary>
RapidRAW is for photographers who love to edit their photos in a <strong>clean, fast, and simple workflow</strong>. It prioritizes speed, a beautiful user interface, and powerful tools that let you achieve your creative color vision quickly.
<br><br>
It is <strong>not</strong> for users who seek absolute, perfect color accuracy. While the results are great for most purposes, the focus is on a fluid, creative process rather than perfect color precision.
<br><br>
RapidRAW is still in active development and isn't yet as polished as mature tools like Darktable, RawTherapee, or Adobe Lightroom®. Right now, the focus is on building a fast, enjoyable core editing experience. You may encounter bugs - if you do, please report them so I can fix them :) Your feedback really helps!

## The Idea

As a photography enthusiast, I often found existing software to be sluggish and resource-heavy on my machine. Born from the desire for a more responsive and streamlined photo editing experience, I set out to build my own. The goal was to create a tool that was not only fast but **also helped me learn the details of digital image processing and camera technology**.

I set an ambitious goal to rapidly build a functional, feature-rich application from an empty folder. This personal challenge pushed me to learn quickly and focus intensely on the core architecture and user experience.

The foundation is built on Rust for its safety and performance, and Tauri for its ability to create lightweight, cross-platform desktop apps with a web frontend. The entire image processing pipeline is offloaded to the GPU via WGPU and a custom WGSL shader, ensuring that even on complex edits with multiple masks, the UI remains fluid.

I am **immensely grateful for Google's Gemini suite of AI models.** As an 18-year-old without a formal background in advanced mathematics or image science, the AI Studio's free tier was an invaluable assistant, helping me research and implement complex concepts in record time.

## Current Priorities

While the core functionality is in place, I'm actively working on improving several key areas. Here's a transparent look at the current focus:

| Task                                                                                         | Priority | Difficulty | Status |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Find a better X-Trans demosaicing algorithm                                                  | Medium  | High     | [ ]    |
| Refactoring the frontend (reduce prop drilling in React components)                         | Low  | Medium     | [ ]    |
| Write a tutorial on how to connect ComfyUI with RapidRAW                                    | Medium | Medium       | [ ]    |
| Centralize Coordinate Transformation Logic - See [#245](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/issues/245) | Medium      | High | [ ]    |
| Improve speed on older systems (e.g. Pascal GPUs)                                            | Medium   | High       | [ ]    |
| Implement warping tools                                                                     | Low  | High       | [X]    |

## AI Roadmap

I've designed RapidRAW's AI features with flexibility in mind. You have three ways to use them, giving you the choice between fast local tools, powerful self-hosting, and simple cloud convenience.

### 1. Built-in AI Tools (Local & Free)

These features are integrated directly into RapidRAW and run entirely on your computer. They are fast, free, and require no setup from you.

*   **AI Masking:** Instantly detect and mask subjects, skies, and foregrounds.
*   **Automatic Tagging:** The image library is automatically tagged with keywords using a local CLIP model, making your photos easy to search.
*   **Simple Generative Replace:** A basic, CPU-based inpainting tool for removing small distractions.

### 2. Self-Hosted Integration with ComfyUI (Local & Free)

For users with a capable GPU who want maximum control, RapidRAW can connect to your own local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) server. This is managed by the [**RapidRAW-AI-Connector**](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW-AI-Connector), a lightweight middleware that bridges RapidRAW and ComfyUI. Its purpose is to manage image caching, workflow injection, and AI coordination.

**Why this approach?** This new architecture makes generative edits much more efficient. Instead of sending the entire high-resolution image for every single change, the AI Connector intelligently caches it. The full image is sent only once; for every subsequent edit, only the tiny mask and text are transferred. This makes the process significantly faster and more responsive.

This setup gives you the best of both worlds: a highly efficient workflow while retaining full control to use your own hardware and any custom Diffusion models or workflows you choose.

*   **Full Control:** Use your own hardware and any custom Diffusion model or workflow you choose.
*   **Cost-Free Power:** Utilise your existing hardware for advanced generative edits at no extra cost.
*   **Custom Workflow Selection:** Import your own ComfyUI workflows and use your custom nodes.

### 3. Optional Cloud Service (Subscription)

To be clear, **I won't lock features behind a paywall.** All of RapidRAW's functionality is available for free if you use the built-in tools or self-host.

However, I realize that not everyone has the powerful hardware or technical desire to set up and maintain their own ComfyUI server. For those who want a simpler solution, I will be offering an optional **$TBD/month subscription**.

This is purely a **convenience service**. It provides the **same high-quality results** as a self-hosted setup without any of the hassle - just log in, and it works. Subscribing is also the best way to support the project and help me dedicate more time to its development.

## Getting Started

You have two options to run RapidRAW:

**1. Download the Latest Release (Recommended)**

**Windows & macOS:**
- Grab the pre-built installer or application bundle for your operating system from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/releases) page.

**Linux:**
- The official Flatpak package supports all Linux distributions and is available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.CyberTimon.RapidRAW).
- On Debian-based distributions, install the `.deb` package from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/releases) page.
- On Arch-based distributions, use the [`rapidraw-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rapidraw-bin) package from the AUR.

**2. Build from Source**

If you want to build the project yourself, you'll need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (including the rawler/dnglab submodule)
git clone https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW.git --recurse-submodules
cd RapidRAW

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build and run the application
npm start
```

## System Requirements

RapidRAW is built to be lightweight and cross-platform. The minimum (tested) requirements are:

**Operating System:**
*   **Windows:** Windows 10 or newer
*   **macOS:** macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer
*   **Linux:** Ubuntu 22.04+ or a compatible modern distribution

**Hardware Recommendations:**
*   **RAM:** **16GB or more is highly recommended.** While the application may run on systems with less memory, performance is best with 16GB+ to handle high-resolution RAW files, undo history, and complex layer masking without slowdowns.
*   **GPU:** A dedicated GPU is recommended. RapidRAW relies heavily on GPU acceleration for its processing pipeline. Very old GPU architectures (generally pre-2015) or older integrated graphics may struggle, leading to instability or graphical artifacts.

### Common Problems

<details>
<summary>App crashes when opening an image / entering edit mode</summary>

If the application crashes immediately when you try to start editing a picture, it is often due to the automatic selection of the GPU backend.

1.  Open **Settings** on the **Home Screen** (Gear icon).
2.  Navigate to the **Processing** tab.
3.  Locate the **Processing Backend** setting.
4.  Change it from **Auto** to a specific backend supported by your OS (e.g., **Vulkan**, **DirectX12**, **OpenGL**, or **Metal**).
5.  Restart the application and try opening the image again. Experiment with different backends if the first one doesn't work.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux Wayland/WebKit Crash</summary>

If RapidRAW crashes on Wayland (e.g. GNOME + NVIDIA), try launching it with:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 RapidRAW
```
or
```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 RapidRAW
```

This issue is related to **WebKit** and **NVIDIA drivers**, not RapidRAW directly. Switching to **X11** or using **AMD / Intel GPUs** may also help.

See [#306](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/issues/306) for more information.
